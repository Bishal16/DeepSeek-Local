### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python & Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

If you haven't installed Python, get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then, create a virtual environment to keep dependencies clean:

```sh
python -m venv deepseek_env
source deepseek_env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
# or
deepseek_env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Inside your activated virtual environment, install the required Python packages:

```sh
pip install streamlit requests
```

If you're hosting this on GitHub and want to set it up quickly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bishal16/DeepSeek-Local.git
